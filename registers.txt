reg 0: ambient temperature (some devices)
reg 1: water temperature

reg 15 = fan speed target
reg 16 = actual fan speed

reg 204 = Td hysteresis off
reg 205 = Td hysteresis on

reg 206 = Td of AUTO-MAX (at setpoint + reg 204 + reg 206 the full fan speed is reached during COOLING)
reg 207 = Td of AUTO-MAX (at setpoint + reg 205 + reg 207 the full fan speed is reached during HEATING)

reg 210 = fan speed AUTO Td=0/NIGHT/MIN (COOLING)
reg 211 = fan speed AUTO Td=0/NIGHT/MIN (HEATING)
reg 212 = fan speed AUTO Td=max (COOLING)
reg 213 = fan speed AUTO Td=max(4) (HEATING)

reg 215 = fan speed NIGHT MODE??
reg 216 = fan speed MAX??


reg 219 maximum water temperature while cooling
reg 218 minimum water temperature while heating

reg 233 heating/cooling info: 3=heating 5=cooling 7=fan_only 0=auto
